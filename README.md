# React-Synth

Why code a synthesizer?

..Why not? I have a fascination with synthesisers and believe that the best songs in the world were created by these. As a practicing Music Technologist during my schooling days, i had put in some research in how these instruments work. Now i get to combine my previous knowledge with the skills garnered on my software developer course, and that sounds like a lot of fun to me. So i'll try and keep this readme updated to reference my ongoing work developing a synthesizer with the React Framework. How exciting!

## DAY 1

I have put together a repository to work on. I have initialised the repository and got to work. First comes the play button to allow the Audio Context API to play a simple tone when it's clicked on. It has a static timer of 2 seconds and will be changed in future to allow an adsr envelope to shape the dynamics.

Next i have created some simple buttons that react with usestate to change the type of my oscillator. It can now play sine, saw, tri and square waves.
I didnt enjoy the use of buttons and thought it might be a better option to create a slider instead.
